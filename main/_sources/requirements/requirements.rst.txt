üìà Status

This section provides an overview of current process requirements and their clarification & implementation status.

.. note::
  All open issues and pull requests in the process repository are considered as if they
  are already part of the process requirements. They address a lot of the
  requirements that are referenced in this document, so we would be blocked if we would
  not consider them as part of the process requirements.

üóÇÔ∏è Common Attributes
#####################

.. note::
  To stay consistent with sphinx-needs (the tool behind docs-as-code), we'll use `need`
  for any kind of model element like a requirement, an architecture element or a
  feature description.

  Docs-as-Code shall enforce that Need IDs follow the following naming scheme:

  * A prefix indicating the need type (e.g. `feature__`)
  * A middle part matching the hierarchical structure of the need:
     * For requirements: a portion of the feature tree or a component acronym
     * For architecture elements: the structural element (e.g. a part of the feature tree, component acronym)
     * For safety analysis (FMEA, DFA): name of analyzed structural element (e.g. Persistency, FEO, etc.)
